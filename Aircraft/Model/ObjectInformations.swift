    static let informations = [ "The MiG-21 was the original “Lightweight Fighter.” Flown by over 50 nations, it continues in use with 19 countries. Powered by a Tumansky turbojet of 12,650 pounds thrust with top speed over Mach 2.0, it is simple and robust, with excellent performance. At maximum gross weight of 15,650 pounds, it has a thrust to weight ratio of over 0.80 for exceptional acceleration and climb. It employed a lighter wing loading than other fighters of its day and was therefore able to outturn virtually all of its competitors. It is the most produced supersonic fighter, more than 11,400 having been built.", "Instantly popular when it was first introduced in 1927, the Waco 10 was an open cockpit, three-place biplane of steel tube and fabric construction. It quickly accounted for more than 40 percent of the aircraft sold in that year with almost one per day rolling out the factory doors. The Waco 10 was initially powered by the cheap and plentiful 90 hp Curtiss OX-5 V-8 engine, but engines up to 300 hp were eventually mounted to the versatile airframe. Ultimately 1,623 of the small biplanes were built between 1927 and 1933 as the Waco Aircraft Co. grew into the largest aircraft builder of the 1930s. — Jeff Skiles, “Miracle on the Hudson” copilot and Waco owner", "Fred Weick’s little side-by-side flier was a revolutionary approach to personal aviation. Designed in the mid-1930s to be so safe that just about anyone could fly one, the Ercoupe, which was an 85 mph cruiser, featured many modern design approaches, including metal construction, excellent visibility and tricycle landing gear. The Ercoupe also boasted two-axis, rudderless, “stall proof” control. But for all of its safety advances, its safety record was no better than those of its contemporaries, and the design bounced around for decades between numerous manufacturers. Today, the Ercoupe is much loved by its hundreds of owners for being a stable, two-seat, fun little flier, just as Weick envisioned", "Designed by Consolidated Aircraft in the late 1930s to outperform the popular B-17, the B-24 Liberator could pack more payload, fly faster and go farther than its Flying Fortress contemporary. The all-metal airplane experienced reduced drag during combat, thanks to its unique roller shutter bomb-bay doors, and came equipped with the first tricycle landing gear outfitted on a heavy aircraft. While the B-24 never attained the kind of fame known by the B-17, it should have. The Liberator participated in all combat theaters and was produced in greater number than any other American aircraft during World War II.", "More so than any other of its aircraft, the Mitsubishi Zero epitomized Japan’s World War II air capabilities. Renowned for its strength as a dogfighter, the lightweight, agile airplane was the first naval fighter that could outperform land aircraft. The Zero would see prolific use throughout the war, as a total of approximately 11,000 of the fighters were produced through 1945, the most by far of any Japanese airplane. With the capability to reach speeds up to 350 mph and a range just shy of 2,000 miles, the aircraft gave the Japanese an early upper hand in combat, one that would subside later in the war with the introduction of more apt American fighters.", "One of the most fascinating stories in all of aviation is that of the Eclipse 500 jet, which was the ultimate private pilot’s dream. With six seats, weighing just 6,000 pounds but capable of 41,000 feet and 370 knots, it seemed too good to be true. Its development and promotion, headed by Vern Raburn, took many years, cost a billion dollars and left hundreds of would-be owners out hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece. After all was said and done, Eclipse went bankrupt, but the airplane survived. The new company has earned a production certificate for the Eclipse jet. It now does everything Raburn always said it would.", "During the 1990s, homebuilding impresario Lance Neibauer decided to see what life on the certified side would look like. His initial foray would be known as the Columbia. Based loosely on the homebuilt Lancair ES, the Columbia launched a formula familiar today, a high-power (310 hp), fixed-gear, sidestick-controlled, low-wing composite speedster with docile flying manners. Columbia Aircraft suffered a series of setbacks — including a freak Oregon hailstorm — and eventually went out of business. Cessna purchased the assets, relaunched production and eventually renamed the airplane the Corvalis. Today the Corvalis, with Garmin avionics and excellent creature comforts, is a premier personal transportation airplane.", "With 20 percent greater fuel efficiency and 20 percent lower carbon emissions than those of its competitors, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is one of the greatest technological advancements to land on the airline scene in decades. Comprised of 50 percent composites, this midsize “plastic” airliner has engines 60 percent quieter than the norm, as well as a range unparalleled by other jets of its class. It’s complete with large, electronically dimmable windows and other passenger amenities, not to mention numerous high-end safety features in the cockpit.", "Initially produced in the late 1930s, the Luscombe Model 8 made its mark on the light aircraft scene with an all-metal monocoque design, the first construction of its kind to thrive on a large scale. The original Model 8 was equipped with a rag wing and a Continental A-50 flat-four engine, but later, more prolific versions of the aircraft traded in the fabric for aluminum and the A-50 for more powerful engines, like the A-65 and the C-90. Thanks to its responsive controls, the high-wing two-seater has garnered a reputation as an aircraft that demands an acute touch from a proficient pilot, a reputation that has endured throughout the decades along with the Luscombe’s appeal among classic aircraft enthusiasts.", "Given more time, Diamond Aircraft’s four-place DA40 DiamondStar could climb dramatically on future lists of the most significant airplanes in history. With its slick, rivet-free fuselage, the DA40 easily outruns and outclimbs a new Cessna 172, despite having the same fuel-efficient, four-cylinder engine. Its long wings give it an impressive 10:1 glide ratio (though the trade-off of low wing loading is a rougher ride in turbulence) and the seats are designed to withstand a 26 G impact. The DA40’s best attributes, in our opinion? An exceptional safety record, good manners in flight, and visibility from the cockpit greenhouse that rivals the scene on an Imax movie screen.", "There’s nothing in the skies remotely like this big, Swiss, pressurized turboprop single, an airplane that’s as comfortable in Cannes as it is in the Canadian Rockies. Introduced in 1991, the PT6-powered PC-12 has been a solid seller for Pilatus thanks to its remarkable versatility, rough-field-ready gear, midsize jet-class cabin, huge side-loading utility door, highly reconfigurable cabin, unreal short-field capabilities and the economies of a single with the payload of some turboprop twins. Today’s PC-12 has an improved gross weight, flat-panel avionics with all the bells and whistles and a high-end BMW-designed interior. Despite all the advances, the PC-12 is still an airplane that yearns for adventure.", "When first certified, the Hawker Beechcraft Premier was the only composite fuselage bizjet and the world’s fastest single-piloted business jet, combining speeds of 0.80 Mach and 320 kias with the largest cabin in its class. Powered by FJ44 engines of 2,300 pounds thrust, it can accommodate six passengers and two pilots with a range of 1,400 nm. Included in the luxurious cabin is a galley and an aft lavatory with a privacy door. The Premier has already established a number of world speed records, breaking existing records by as much as 200 mph. It has appeared at the Reno Air Races, flying the racecourse in one of its more notable appearances. — Robert “Hoot” Gibson", "Kelly Johnson’s SR-71 was conceived during the 1950s as a stealthy reconnaissance ship that would fly too high and fast for enemy missiles to reach. Though limited to about 2,000 knots by aerodynamic heating, the SR-71’s speed has never been surpassed by any manned jet. Its fuselage chines, conceived as stealth aids, became an important aerodynamic feature of many later aircraft. Lightly built of titanium and stainless steel, the Blackbird was leaky, not very maneuverable, and given to cantankerous engine behavior, but it remains possibly the most fantastic-looking — and to many eyes the most beautiful — airplane ever to fly.", "When the first Hawker Siddeley 125 prototype took flight in 1962, the aircraft became arguably the first official production business jet to take to the skies. Initially powered by twin 3,000-pound thrust Viper turbojet engines, the revolutionary aircraft was slightly slower than its competitors, but more than made up for it in cabin comfort and economy. Those attributes helped lay the foundation for one of the most top-selling bizjet lines in history. The Hawker line survives four decades later, as new production aircraft roll off Hawker Beechcraft’s Wichita assembly lines with an airframe based on the 125 in a testament to the jet’s brilliant original design.", "87. Bleriot XI In 1908 Frenchman Louis Bleriot designed the mono-wing Bleriot XI — a wood and fabric design steerable by wing warping. Powered by a 25 hp Anzani engine spinning a wooden propeller, the airplane carried Bleriot across the English Channel in a little more than 36 minutes on July 25, 1909, becoming the first airplane to complete the crossing. The popularity of the airplane, gleaned from the historic flight, inspired Bleriot to mass-produce it. Many famous aviation pioneers flew the Bleriot XI including Clyde Cessna, whose first airplane was a near twin of the Bleriot XI.", "An outgrowth of the lower-powered and much maligned Piper Apache (which was actually inspired by a Stinson design), the Piper Aztec, introduced in 1958, was an immediate hit with pilots looking for a tough and capable twin that flew great. With a pair of six-cylinder Lycoming engines each putting out 250 horses, the Aztec wasn’t fast. But it could carry a great load and operate out of rough strips. With fuel-injected (1960 and later) and, later, turbocharged models, the six-place Aztec was in production for a quarter of a century with nearly 8,000 examples produced over that time. “My favorite airplane is the Piper Aztec. The Aztec has enabled Sandy and me to visit many wonderful places not available to the airlines or faster aircraft. We’ve been to the East Coast, West Coast, Gulf Coast, Caribbean, Canada, Mexico and South America. The best times were in the Caribbean, island hopping and making reservations on 122.8. Montserrat was the island of choice until the volcano blew. It’s easy to fly, carries a lot of weight and still goes 200 miles an hour. You can buy one for almost nothing, hang new engines, add radios, interior and a paint job and you have a fine piece of equipment for under $300,000.”", "Great aviators don’t care that their dream project appears impossible. And though a round-the-world flight on one tank of gas appears unimaginable, Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager made it happen in 1986. The airplane that made the concept a reality was the Voyager — a minimalistic but aerodynamically efficient carbon fiber airframe designed by Dick’s brother, engineering legend Burt Rutan. The Voyager carried 7,011.5 pounds of fuel when it began its takeoff roll from Edwards Air Force Base, and it was barely able to evade disaster when the weight-laden wingtips sent sparks flying as they scraped the tarmac. After a little more than nine days, Rutan and Yeager completed their historic mission and landed the Voyager safely back at Edwards.", "The Dassault Falcon 7X holds many notable distinctions, two of the most important being its status as the first fully fly-by-wire business jet and as the first to be designed entirely on the Catia virtual platform. The resulting airplane is Dassault’s flagship model, combining three engines (a hallmark of the French airframer) with a high cruise speed, nearly 6,000 nm range and a roomy cabin. Unveiled to the public at the 2005 Paris Air Show, the model gained FAA and EASA type certification in 2007. More than 150 have been built to date.", "Originally a co-development product between Mooney and French company and current owner Socata (based in Tarbes, France), the TBM-700 was a new kind of airplane when it was introduced in the late 1980s and certified in 1990. The single-turboprop, pressurized speedster featured a compact-but-luxurious cabin for four and boasted speeds of around 300 knots with a range exceeding 1,500 nm. Over the years the airplane has gotten nothing but better, with true airspeeds of better than 320 knots on its higher-horsepower Pratt engine, additional gross weight, flat-panel avionics and updated interior. More than 500 TBMs have been delivered.", "Built in the 1930s as a platform for spreading aviation to the masses, the Taylorcraft emerged as a safe, light flier capable of outpacing the Cub and the Champ. While the aircraft’s side-by-side seating made for a tight cockpit and limited visibility, its expansive wings and clean design gave it great get-up-and-go as well as stellar gliding characteristics. The aircraft’s heightened sensitivity to pilot inputs has acutely sharpened the flying skills of many more than just a handful of individuals over the years, staking a claim for the T’craft near the top of the list of great post-World War II tube-and-rag taildraggers.", "Since the F-22 emerged in 2005, this fifth-generation fighter has combined cutting-edge stealth technology with supersonic cruise capability and superb air combat maneuverability unmatched by any fighter in the world. Powered by 35,000 pounds of thrust per engine, the single-pilot aircraft is able to reach speeds beyond Mach 2.0 with the use of afterburners and speeds above Mach 1.5 without them. The aircraft’s stealth technology gives it a radar signature the size of a steel marble, while the jet’s sensor fusion offers its pilots better situational awareness than ever. High development costs and operational glitches have plagued the Raptor but haven’t prevented the jet from staking its claim as the most advanced tactical fighter on the planet.", "With the carrying capability of the Caravan, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that FedEx contributed ideas to the design. Since dispatch reliability was also of primary concern for the small-package shipping giant, the 208 was equipped with a tried-and-true Pratt & Whitney PT6 turboprop engine producing 600 hp (later upgraded to 675 hp). But versatility is probably the word that describes the Caravan best. The airplane can be equipped with a cargo pod and multiple types of landing gear, including bush tires, amphibs and skis. Excellent STOL capabilities allow this reasonably large airplane to get in and out of tight backcountry airstrips.", "A pioneer of fly-by-wire flight controls and sidesticks, the Airbus A320 family, when it was introduced into service in 1988, represented an enormous technological leap for a company that was then still a distant competitor to Boeing. Fast-forward to today, and the airplane has earned a spot as one of the best-selling airliners of all time, with production numbers approaching the 5,000 mark. Design of the A320 actually began much earlier, in 1981, and was envisioned as a modern design that would outperform the Boeing 737. Today, Airbus is a strong competitor to Boeing, producing an entire line of FBW airliners.", "The tailwheel Decathlon is a study in perseverance. The airplane traces its roots back to the Aeronca Champ, by way of the aerobatic-minded American Champion Citabria. In fact, American Champion developed the Decathlon as a better Citabria. The airplane entered production in 1970, but the company was immediately sold to Bellanca. Bellanca built the airplane and the follow-on Super Decathlon until it went belly up in 1981. The Decathlon design passed through the hands of several companies until in 1988 it ended up in the hands of a new company: American Champion Aircraft Corp., which also acquired the Champ, Citabria and Scout designs. The Super Decathlon and other models are being produced to this day at the American Champion factory in Rochester, Wisconsin.", "The brainchild of legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan, the Beechcraft Starship was a radical departure from conventional designs, starting fresh with many untried concepts. Featuring twin-pusher turboprop engines, canard configuration and composite construction, the Starship was well ahead of its time when Beechcraft contracted with Rutan’s Scaled Composites in 1981 to build an 85-percent-scale proof of concept. That project culminated with the flight of the first production Starship in 1989. Despite excellent performance, in the end, only 53 Starships were built. Beechcraft blamed slow sales of the model on a down economy and the airplane’s unconventional looks. In 2003, Beech began buying back Starships and cutting them up. Only five privately owned Starships remain today.", "After working for several helicopter manufacturers, including Cessna (yes, Cessna did sell a helicopter — the Skyhook), Bell and Hughes, Frank Robinson saw an opportunity to launch his own light design. After six years of development, Robinson Helicopters introduced the R22, which received FAA certification in 1979. With a reasonable purchase price and low operating cost, the two-seat, two-blade design became a huge success, enabling Robinson to expand his company’s product offering. Thirty-two years after the R22 was introduced, more than 10,000 Robinson helicopters have been delivered out of the ever-expanding factory in Torrance, California.", "An engineering marvel, the F-16 Fighting Falcon can fly at Mach 2 speeds above 50,000 feet while being able to withstand 9 Gs. The fly-by-wire control system is activated by a sidestick and enables F-16 pilots to turn the airplane on a dime. Its capabilities as an air-to-air fighter as well as an air-to-surface attack platform have made it a favorite among Air Force squadrons worldwide. Since its first introduction in 1979, Lockheed Martin has delivered thousands of F16s of various models. Regardless of the configuration, the loud roar of the single F-16 engine emanates fear in the enemy and excitement in airshow spectators.", "Designed by aeronautical engineer Paul MacCready, the Gossamer Albatross was a human-powered airplane that in 1979 made the first human-powered flight across the English Channel. Piloted by cyclist Bryan Allen, the Albatross made the trip in two hours and 49 minutes, winning the Kremer Prize. Two years earlier, MacCready won a prize for the first human-powered aircraft, the Gossamer Condor. The Albatross was even more ambitious. Constructed of carbon fiber with a strong yet light Mylar covering and a wingspan of nearly 100 feet, the canard-configuration Albatross brought to the attention of the world the work of forward-thinking aircraft designers and opened people’s eyes to the wide-open future of flight.", "Designed in the mid-1950s, the Gulfstream 1 was the first twin turboprop designed specifically for corporate travel. The aircraft had a range of 2,200 miles, room for 12 passengers and maxed out at a speed of 350 mph at 25,000 feet. A product of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Co., the aircraft’s name hails from the coast of Florida, a favored vacation locale for Grumman execs. Loved by crew and passengers alike, the Gulfstream 1 enjoyed success that ushered in a new era of business travel and set the groundwork for one of the most successful lines of business jets in aviation history.", "The P-38 Lightning was one of only two American fighters in service throughout all of U.S. involvement in World War II, from Pearl Harbor to V-J Day. The airplane employed distinctive twin-boom tails, earning it the nickname “fork-tailed devil” by the Luftwaffe. The P-38 scored its biggest victories in the Pacific and was the primary long-range fighter of the Army Air Forces until the P-51 Mustang started arriving in large numbers toward the end of the war. Designed by Lockheed engineer Clarence “Kelly” Johnson and his team, the P-38 represented one of the most radical departures in the history of American fighter development. The Lightning was a complete breakaway from conventional designs, yet its odd looks yielded the power of two engines and, at long last, the ability to carry heavy armament.", "The tsunami of orders for Jim Bede’s BD-5 inspired a then-unknown Burt Rutan to design his own mass-market homebuilt with sexy looks, great performance, a cheap engine and two seats rather than one. Neither the swept-wing canard configuration, nor the fiberglass-over-foam construction, nor the use of slightly converted Volkswagen engines was unprecedented. But when Rutan put it together and it did 170 knots, the world took notice. The VariEze and its larger successor, the Long-EZ, were built in the thousands and hold many records. More important, they made Burt Rutan, the most innovative designer of his time, a household name.", "Originally produced by Canadair in the late 1970s, the Bombardier Challenger introduced a number of cutting-edge innovations into the world of corporate air travel. In addition to its wide and roomy cabin, which brought spaciousness to a bizjet like never before, the aircraft was also one of the earliest to employ the low-drag supercritical wing. With a deadly prototype crash and initial weight limitations, the Bombardier Challenger got off to a rocky start, but persevered to emerge as the bedrock of one of the most thriving lines of corporate jets in aviation history.", "The brainchild of modern composite guru Walter Extra, the Extra 300 burst onto the scene in the early 1990s as the ultimate competitive aerobat. A certificated or experimental airplane, the 300 was incredibly quick, nimble and strong (certified to plus/minus 10 Gs but thought much stronger), allowing competitors to do maneuvers no one had done before. It was a huge force in aerobatic competition, pushing the state of the art to new heights. Flown by aerobatics legend Patty Wagstaff in airshows and competitions far and wide and popularized in Microsoft’s Flight Simulator, the 300 also became the embodiment of the aerobatic monoplane.", "As the first successful strike fighter able to perform vertical landings, the BAE Harrier jet built upon the successes of its first generation predecessor and brought a slew of revolutionary capabilities to the forefront of Western air defense. The aircraft was a product of both American and British innovation and, like earlier Harrier jets, relied on thrust vectoring technology for its wide range of vertical and horizontal maneuverability. With that maneuverability, a more powerful engine, an airframe composed substantially of composites and more payload capacity, the BAE Harrier emerged as a multidimensional and very capable strike fighter.", "At just 78 feet shorter than the Titanic, the Hindenburg remains the largest aircraft ever to take to the air more than seven decades after its maiden flight in 1936. Built on the success of its predecessor, the Graf Zeppelin, the Hindenburg was equipped to hold more than 7 million cubic feet of hydrogen and could produce 242.2 tons of gross lift, an amount 112 tons greater than its own weight. While the Hindenburg was originally designed to use helium, the United States refused to yield its monopoly on the substance to Nazi Germany, resulting in a recrafting of the zeppelin for hydrogen. The aircraft carried more than 2,500 passengers across the Atlantic before it burst into flames while landing in Lakehurst, New Jersey, in 1937, killing 36 people and attracting enough press attention to end the burgeoning era of passenger airship travel.", "The Challenger business jet heritage is evident when looking at the pointy nose and wide fuselage of Bombardier’s Canadair Regional Jet. With several variants offering seating capacities between 40 and 100 passengers, the CRJ line quickly became a favorite among regional airlines around the world after its introduction in 1992. The twin-engine jet design enabled not only quick and economical short hops, but also cost-efficient midrange flights previously serviced only by heavier aircraft, such as the Boeing 737, often flying with many empty seats. In addition to increasing load factors, the CRJs helped the airlines increase their route offerings significantly. More than 1,600 CRJs have been delivered to date.", "The Bell X-1 holds a place in aviation history as the first airplane to fly faster than the speed of sound in controlled level flight. The X-1 was also the first airplane in the X series of super-secret U.S. military experimental aircraft designed to test cutting-edge technologies. On Oct. 14, 1947, just a month after the Air Force had been created as a separate service, Capt. Charles “Chuck” Yeager broke the speed of sound in the rocket-powered Bell X-1 christened Glamorous Glennis, after his wife. The milestone earned the X-1 program the 1948 Collier Trophy and made its young test pilot a household name", "When Cessna released the 185 Skywagon back in 1961, the company hit the sweet spot of payload, capacity, speed, economy and backcountry fun. Decades after going out of production, the Cessna 185 is still hailed by bush pilots in Alaska (and elsewhere) as one of their most popular workhorses. Whether on skis, floats or wheels, the 185 can get you, your friends and your gear in and out of most remote places. And its reliability is likely to get you out as well, as long as you know how to wrestle a tailwheel airplane with a 260 hp Continental up front.", "Beechcraft hit the jackpot in the early 1960s with the Baron, a sleek swept-tail personal twin derived from the somewhat clunky looking Travel Air and straight-tail Debonair single. Unlike Beech’s previous twins, the Baron captured the magic of the Bonanza. It was fast, easy to fly, comfortable and could haul a decent load. In the day of cheap avgas and twin-engine prestige, the Baron was king. Over the 50-plus years of Barons, Beech churned out thousands, from the original model 55, with 260 hp Continentals, to turbocharged and pressurized models to today’s million-dollar-plus flat-panel equipped G58 Baron.", "Until Gulfstream achieves full certification and starts delivering its G650, Cessna’s Citation X can still claim its spot as the fastest civil airplane in the sky. With its Fadec-controlled Rolls-Royce AE3007C1 engines, which are about the size of some single-engine airplane fuselages and each produce 6,674 pounds of thrust at sea level, the airplane can cruise near the speed of sound at Mach 0.92. The Citation X earned Cessna the Collier Trophy when it was introduced in 1996. In 2010, Cessna felt the popular business jet needed a face-lift and announced a slightly larger version, simply called “The Ten,” which is expected to hit the market in 2013 with a Garmin G5000 touch screen panel in place of the X’s Primus 2000 Elite and lots of other upgrades. “To say that I am not somewhat biased regarding the Citation X would be an understatement. I recommended to my friends at Cessna a few requirements that I wanted to see in a corporate jet prior to the Citation X. My main points were that it should have these key attributes: speed, range and a large cabin size. I had the honor of taking delivery of the first production Citation X in August 1996, and am delighted to say that it has been everything I envisioned. Fifteen-plus years later, we are still flying a Citation X (I traded in for a new one in 2002) and I could not be more pleased. It is reliable and still the fastest bird out there, looks great, and deserves to be ranked among the greatest airplanes of all time.” — Arnold Palmer", "The P.180 Avanti twin-pusher turboprop started as a collaboration between Piaggio of Italy and Learjet to design and produce a sleek, modern turboprop capable of taking on the Beech King Air and even business jets. Learjet dropped out of the program in early 1986, but Piaggio forged ahead, flying the prototype nine months later. Although U.S. and European certification was obtained in 1990, the project languished for the next eight years due to funding woes and, probably, buyer apprehension over the Avanti’s odd looks. In 1998, a group of investors led by Piero Ferrari became involved. By then the Avanti had proved its capabilities, and sales soon followed. In 2005 the improved Avanti II earned its certification and, with its updated PT6s and modern Rockwell Collins avionics, was an immediate hit. Piaggio has produced more than 200, and sales have stayed strong.", "Designed and developed in secrecy in the 1950s, this high-flying reconnaissance aircraft was not revealed to the public until one was shot down over Soviet territory in 1960. The Lockheed U-2, also known as the Dragon Lady, would go on to play a key role in Cold War surveillance missions for decades to come, while also serving in the Vietnam War and as a NASA research platform. With its light airframe and sailplane-like wings, the Lockheed U-2’s design suited its purpose well, enabling it to achieve altitudes at least up to 70,000 feet. Those same characteristics, however, made the U-2 notoriously difficult to fly, with minimal room for error between the max and stall speeds as well as landing characteristics that required the assistance of a chase car to help guide the aircraft to the ground.", "The de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver is an airplane worshipped by bush pilots and rightfully so. As big as the Beaver is, with room for up to seven passengers, it requires only light control input and the three engine control levers in the center of the glareshield give the airplane a unique look and feel. The airplane’s rugged tailwheel design and ability to haul a heavy load make it impossible to beat in the backcountry. The sound of the Beaver’s nine-cylinder Pratt & Whitney and the beautiful shape of the fuselage put a smile on the face of anyone who loves airplanes. “If I could have only one airplane, I’d keep my de Havilland Beaver. Mine’s on gear, a great backcountry airplane. Prime, wobble-pump, start … a puff of smoke and the rumble of that 985 make you feel you’ve woken a dragon. In the air she’s balanced, light on the controls. Trimmed up, you can fly with two fingers. Right hand up on the throttle, prop and mix. Feel how the thumb advances the engine and the index finger hooks over the prop lever to bring it back — perfect. Pump down the flaps, slow up and put her just about anywhere. A pilot’s dream.” — Harrison Ford", "While Embraer had been building private-jet versions of a couple of its successful regional airliners for a few years, it wasn’t until it launched the Phenom 100 that it committed to a purpose-built bizjet. The twinjet hits a sweet spot among private buyers and air-taxi firms seeking a lower-priced business jet with a usable cabin size (up to six passengers) and reasonably fast speed (390 knots) with decent range (1,176 nm) while doing it with an airline quality build. In addition to its remarkable entry-level performance, the Phenom 100 features large flat-panel avionics, fadec turbofans and operating economies that rival some turboprop twins.", "First delivered in 1947, the stately five-place, all-metal Cessna 195 radial-engine taildragger was new in some ways but outdated in others — its big radial engine and conventional gear were 1930s technology. It was a relaxing airplane to fly, but with its heavy radial engine, it was a thrilling one to land in a crosswind. Some models featured a crosswind gear, which would allow the airplane to be pointed in one direction and the gear in another. In the end, the 195 could never compete with the truly modern Beech Bonanza (with tricycle gear and an opposed engine) and Cessna ended production of the 195 in 1954. “The Cessna 195 is one of the finest classics ever built by any manufacturer. Most people identify with the art deco styling of this plane, built between 1947 and 1954. The graceful cantilever wing, large roomy fuselage, radial engine and piano key switches are just some of the details that set this incredible machine apart from the rest. The 195 was the evolution of the original Cessna Airmaster and became known as the “Businessliner” thanks to its wonderful performance. The useful load, low fuel consumption, great handling characteristics and relatively high cruising speed set it apart in its day. Today it is still a very reliable, sought after classic. Just listen to one start up on the ramp and you will understand!” — Jack Pelton", "This is the airplane that started the Dassault tradition of three-engine business jets. Introduced in the 1970s, the Falcon 50 was an immediate hit with pilots and buyers alike, offering a winning combination of excellent range, great runway performance, a spacious cabin and an attractive form. The three-engine configuration gave the model better hot-and-high performance and presented pilots with more options when flying long oceanic routes. Dassault produced the model for more than 20 years, replacing the original with the Falcon 50EX, which boasted more powerful engines and upgraded avionics. Successors to the prototypical three-engine Falcon 50 configuration are the equally popular Falcon 900 and 7X models.", "With a tail the height of a six-story building and a wing area bigger than a basketball court, the Boeing 747 truly earned its keep as the world’s first jumbo jet. Despite the aircraft’s whopping 735,000-pound weight, the 747-100’s four P&W JT9D-3 engines each provided 43,000 pounds of thrust, allowing the aircraft to achieve a range of 6,000 miles and a cruising speed of 640 mph. Initially flown by Pan Am in 1970, the 747 held the top spot in terms of passenger capacity for nearly 40 years, with later models capable of carrying up to 550 people on a given flight. In addition to logging enough miles to fly to the moon and back more than 100,000 times, the 747 has also served as the Air Force One aircraft of choice in a modified version for more than two decades and as a carrier for NASA’s space shuttle fleet.", "With a look at once arresting, sleek and classic, the Beechcraft Staggerwing endures today as one of the most aesthetically pleasing aircraft of all time. That allure didn’t come at the cost of power either, since the aircraft’s unique wing alignment, mighty radial engine and retractable landing gear allow it to top out at speeds above 200 mph without the threat of high stall values. Designed amid the Great Depression and considered a risky venture by some, the Staggerwing went on to become the premier aircraft for the elite, a celebrated air racer and versatile warbird. The airplane, each model handcrafted to perfection, would also set the standard for one of the most successful manufacturers in GA history.", "The V-22 tiltrotor is perhaps the first aircraft that went into a museum before it entered service. Originated in 1981 and followed by first flight in 1989, the V-22 wasn’t introduced to the Marine Corps or Air Force until 2007 and 2009, respectively. From the start, the V-22 was beset by setbacks, including crashes of two prototypes in the early 1990s that almost led to the program’s cancellation. The Clinton Administration was a strong backer of the tiltrotor concept, keeping the Bell/Boeing joint program alive. Today the V-22 is in full-rate production and is serving admirably as a replacement for the Sea Knight helicopter troop transport.", "First introduced in 1967, the Piper Arrow emerged as a great training platform for pilots looking to get their feet wet in a complex single-engine aircraft. While not as fast as some of its contemporaries, the Arrow provided the familiarity and forgiving nature of the Piper line with a level of affordability within reach of more pilots. Equipped with a 200 hp Lycoming engine, a range of 880 nm and a fuel capacity of 72 gallons, the four-seat Arrow remains in limited production today and endures as a great airplane for advanced student pilots and cross-country travelers alike.", "Proudly remembered as the aircraft that helped save the United Kingdom during the Battle of Britain, the Supermarine Spitfire has gained iconic status as one of the most famous fighters of all time. The aircraft’s signature elliptical wings and sleek aerodynamic design gave it exceptional speed and maneuverability, which, combined with the fighter’s eight machine guns, made the Spitfire a formidable foe. First introduced in 1938, the Spitfire was continually improved and upgraded throughout the war. The fighter would go on to become the most-produced British aircraft of World War II and would eventually serve the country and its Allies in numbers greater than 20,000.", "The legendary Connie has to be one of the prettiest airplanes ever conceived. With its sinuously curving fuselage, triple tail and tapered wing, it is instantly recognizable. In 1939, TWA and Hughes asked Lockheed for a 40-passenger transcontinental airliner with a top speed of more than 340 mph, and the designers delivered. It wasn’t until after World War II that the Constellation truly came into its own as a fast, long-haul transport (this despite a number of high-profile crashes that temporarily grounded the fleet). Lockheed built more than 850, with the Connie and later the Super Connie ruling the skies until the introduction of turbojet airliners in the 1950s.", "The Cessna Cardinal was actually intended as a replacement to the Skyhawk, but that never happened. Still, the Cardinal, with its great visibility, cantilever wing and easy-entry doors, did take an important place in the Cessna pantheon not only as arguably the most beautiful Cessna ever but as a solid and reliable mid-performance personal and family airplane as well. Early on it got better handling, more power, better speed and a constant-speed prop. Cessna even built an RG model, two of which were owned at various points by Flying alums Tom Benenson and Richard Collins. Between 1968 and 1978, more than 1,500 Cardinals were delivered.", "With its maiden flight in 1944, the Aeronca Champ emerged as an attractive training alternative in a world dominated by the Piper Cub. Complete with a wider cabin, the ability to solo in the front seat and user-friendly controls, the tandem trainer offered a roomy alternative to the Piper Cub, one that had the upper hand not only when it came to visibility, but also, many of its proponents will argue, in human engineering. While the Champ didn’t gain the kind of lasting prestige acquired by its Piper competitor, it nevertheless amassed its own substantial group of devoted admirers and was produced in numbers surpassing 10,000."
